# Data-Science-Portfolio

Repository containing examples of data science projects completed for both academic and self learning purposes.

### Contents:

* Anomaly Detection of Exotic Particle Physics Events at the Large Hadron Collider:
  * Designed an anomaly detection algorithm which is trained on a 'normal physics' dataset in order to flag up interesting (exotic) events from the Beyond the Standard Model of Physics.
  * This was performed using a robust Autoencoder, trained on particle kinematics.
* Machine Learning Classification for Exotic Particle Physics:
  * Employed a Neural Network Classifier to determine whether it can improve the sensitivity of the search for exotic particles.
    Performed via Hypothesis testing.
* Parameter Estimation of Particle Decay:
  *  Determined the expected statistical precision of measured parameters given 10,000 events using toy Monte Carlo event generation and maximum likelihood estimation of a probabilistic model.
  *  Determined whether there was a possible bias on the data/parameters due to an unaccounted for background.
